# EDA: Confidence Intervals on District Literacy Rates

This repository demonstrates a hands-on exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercise in Python, focusing on:

- Sampling district literacy rate data
- Calculating sample mean and standard error
- Constructing 95% and 99% confidence intervals
- Interpreting statistical results for data-driven insights


## Key Takeaways

1. Confidence intervals quantify uncertainty around sample estimates.
2. Increasing the confidence level widens the interval, highlighting the trade-off between precision and confidence.
3. Proper variable selection is crucial to avoid misleading results.

## Tools Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
